# ResNet_Model
Scratch code for ResNet model

Contains:

Tensorflow model: 
Simple, only use basic tensorflow functions(no resnet_utils functions)
Use to understand basic idea of ResNet
Convert from tensorflow ResNet API

Keras model:
Contains 2 models. 1/ One simple model same idea of Tensorflow file.
2/ Another model is use loop function to reduce the size of code
